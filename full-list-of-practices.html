        <img class="grpelem" id="u2418-97" alt="Self-kindness practices gifts of mercy 1. Find a quiet place to sit. 2. Relax for two minutes, breathing in and out naturally. During each exhale, focus on the word &quot;one.&quot; Keep your arms, legs, and body still. 3. Identify a time in the past when another person hurt or offended you. 4. For the next two minutes, think of the offender as a human being who behaved badly. Even if the relationship cannot be restored, try to genuinely wish that this person experiences something positive or healing. Even though it may be hard, focus your thoughts and feelings on gifts of mercy or compassion. Be consciously aware of the thoughts, feelings, and physical responses you have as you cultivate compassion, kindness, and mercy for this person. detach emotions from self 1. Bring awareness to your experience without judgment. 2. Remind yourself of the following if it applies to you: &quot;I am having a hard time&quot; &quot;I don't know how to do this alone&quot; &quot;I feel powerless&quot; &quot;I wish I could see things differently&quot; &quot;I don't know how to accept myself as I am right now&quot; 3. Work on thinking about your emotions and depression as something you're experiencing rather than who you are and start to dis-identify yourself from your depression. Allow yourself to understand and feel your emotions without them overpowering who you are. WRITE A LETTER: 1. Imagine your loved one is struggling with the same depressive thoughts. 2. Write this person a letter. What would you say to them? What compassion, love, and tenderness might you offer? 3. Address the letter to yourself. 4. Read it aloud. Finding Silver Linings 1. To start, list five things that make you feel like your life is enjoyable, enriching, and/or worthwhile at this moment. These things can be as general as “being in good health” or as specific as “drinking a delicious cup of coffee this morning.” The purpose of this first step is to help you shift into a positive state of mind about your life in general. 2. Next, think about the most recent time when something didn’t go your way, or when you felt frustrated, irritated, or upset. 3. In a few sentences, briefly describe the situation in writing. 4. Then, list three things that can help you see the bright side of this situation. For example, perhaps you missed your bus this morning. Three ways to look on the bright side of this situation might be: 5. Even though you missed the bus, you got some good exercise when you were running to catch it. 6. You’re fortunate to live in a city where there was another bus just 10 minutes later, or where buses run reliably at all. 7. Ten years from now, you likely won’t remember what happened this morning. Emotional Freedom Techniques: Tapping 1. Intentionally focus on your anxiety/fear/insecurity, for example “I am not strong enough” on a scale 0-10 rate how intense the emotion it. 2. Now starting at the tapping point on your wrist, tap this point while saying 3 times “Even though I am feeling fear, I deeply and completely love and accept myself”. 3. Proceed to tap the spot at the end of your eyebrow reciting the negative emotion, then moving to the outside of your eye, below your eye, above your lip, below your lip/above your chin, between your collar bones at the bottom of your throat, under your armpit and on the top of your head, at each spot reciting the negative emotion while tapping. 4. Repeat this 2 times and then take a deep cleansing breath. Reassess on a scale of 1-10 how true you feel the negative emotion is. identifying what i really want 1. Think about the ways that you use self-criticism as a motivator. Is there any personal trait that you criticize yourself for having (too overweight, too lazy, too impulsive, etc.) because you think being hard on yourself will help you change? If so, first try to get in touch with the emotional pain that your self-criticism causes, giving yourself compassion for the experience of feeling so judged. 2. Next, see if you can think of a kinder, more caring way to motivate yourself to make a change if needed. What language would a wise and nurturing friend, parent, teacher, or mentor use to gently point out how your behavior is unproductive, while simultaneously encouraging you to do something different. What is the most supportive message you can think of that’s in line with your underlying wish to be healthy and happy? 3. Every time you catch yourself being judgmental about your unwanted trait in the future, first notice the pain of your self-judgment and give yourself compassion. Then try to reframe your inner dialogue so that it is more encouraging and supportive. Remember that if you really want to motivate yourself, love is more powerful than fear!

With your attention geared to the other person, tell yourself : &quot;Just like me, this person is seeking happiness in their life.&quot; &quot;Just like me, this person is trying to avoid suffering in their life.&quot; &quot;Just like me, this person has known sadness, loneliness, and despair.&quot; &quot;Just like me, this person is seeking to fill their needs.&quot; &quot;Just like me, this person is learning about life.&quot; With your eyes closed, sit in a comfortable position on the floor with your spine straight, keeping your body relaxed.

Imagine him or her standing on your right side, sending warm wishes and love for your safety, wellbeing, and happiness Bring to mind another person who loves you. Imagine him or her on your left side, also sending warm wishes and love Now picture all of the people who love and have loved you. Imagine they are surrounding you, sending wishes for your safety, wellbeing, and happiness SENDING LOVING-KINDNESS Bring your awareness back to the person you imagined standing on your right side. Send the love that you feel back to that person; just like you, that person wishes to be happy. Repeat the following phrase silently: “May you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be free from pain.” Now focus your awareness on the person you imagined standing to your left. Send the love that you feel back to that person: “Just as I wish to, may you be safe, may you be healthy, may you live with ease and happiness.” Now picture another person you love. Send the love that you feel back to that person. Repeat the following phrase silently: “May your life be filled with happiness, health, and well-being.” Now think of an acquaintance. Send that person love and repeat the following phrase: “May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be free from all pain.” Lastly, imagine all beings on the globe.

Stand up and feel the soles of your feet. Rock back and forth a little, and side to side. Make little circles with your knees, feeling the changes of sensation in the soles of your feet. 3. When you notice your mind has wandered, return your mind to the soles of your feet again. 4. If you wish, you can begin to walk slowly, noticing the changing sensation in the soles of your feet. Noticing the sensation of lifting a food, stepping forward, and then placing the foot on the floor. 5. As you walk, perhaps also notice for a moment how small the surface area of your feet is, and how hard your feet work to keep your body off the ground. See if you can notice that with appreciation and gratitude. Soften-Soothe-Allow Practice 1. Beginning with Breath and Kindness: Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take three relaxing breaths. Place your hand on your heart for a few moments to remind yourself that you are in the room, and to bring kindness to yourself. 2. Labeling the Emotion: Let yourself recall a mild-moderately difficult situation that you are in right now, perhaps a health problem, stress in a relationship, or a loved one in pain. Do not choose a very difficult problem, or a trivial problem—choose a problem that can generate a little stress in your body when you think of it. Now clearly visualize the situation. Who was there? What was said? What happened? Now see if you can name the strongest emotion—a difficult emotion—associated with that situation: anger? sadness? grief? confusion? fear? longing? despair? Repeat the name of the emotion to yourself in a gentle, understanding voice, as if you were validating for a friend what he/she is feeling: “That’s longing.” “That’s grief.” 3. Bringing Mindfulness of Emotion into the Body: Expand your awareness to your body as a whole. Recall the difficult situation again and scan your body for where you feel it the most. In your mind’s eye, sweep your body from head to toe, stopping where you can sense a little tension or discomfort. Now choose a single location in your body where the feeling expresses itself most strongly, perhaps as a point of muscle tension or an achy feeling, like a heartache. In your mind, incline gently toward that spot. Soften, Soothe, and Allow: Soften into that location in your body. Let the muscles be soft without a requirement that they become soft, like simply applying heat to sore muscles. You can say, “soft…soft…soft…” quietly to yourself, to enhance the process. Remember that you are not trying to make the sensation go away—you are just being with it with loving awareness. You can let yourself just soften around the edges, like around the edges of a pancake. No need to go all the way in. Soothe yourself for struggling in this way. Put your hand over your heart and feel your body breathe. Perhaps kind words arise in our mind, such as, “Oh my dear, this is such a painful experience. I’m so sorry it’s so hard for you right now”. If you wish, you can also direct kindness to the part of your body that is under stress by placing your hand in that place. It may help to think of your body as if it were the body of a beloved child. You can say kind words to yourself, or just repeat, “soothe…soothe…soothe.” Allow the discomfort to be there. Abandon the wish for the feeling to disappear. Let the discomfort come and go as it pleases, like a guest in your own home. You can repeat, “allow…allow…allow.” “Soften, soothe and allow.” “Soften, soothe and allow.” You can use these three words like a mantra, reminding yourself to incline with tenderness toward your suffering. If you experience too much discomfort with an emotion, stay with your breath until you feel better. Easing back out… When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes, letting your attention move out into the world around you. Mindful eating Try to keep quiet during the exercise and focus all of your attention on the chocolate. Approach the exercise with an open mind and a gentle curiosity. 1. Pick up your wrapped chocolate but don’t unwrap it yet. 2. Place it in the palm of your hand and notice the colors and shapes on the package. 3. Feel the weight of it in your hand. 4. Pretend like you have never seen a wrapped chocolate bar before and examine it closely. 5. Touch the packaging with your fingers and feel the texture. Pay attention to any sound the wrapper makes. Examine the wrapper noticing all of the colors. Look at the different sides of the chocolate wrapper and notice any place that the light reflects off the package, any shadows. 6. If your mind starts to wander and think about other things, that’s ok. Notice the thoughts and bring your attention back to the chocolate. 7. Now begin to slowly open the wrapper. Listen for the sounds of the wrapper tearing. Notice the movement of your hand, fingers, and arm muscles as you open the chocolate. 8. You may hear other people or other noises in the room. Notice the sounds and bring your attention back to the chocolate. 9. Raise the chocolate to your nose and smell the chocolate. Slowly breathe in several times and focus on the different smells. Does smelling the chocolate trigger anything else in your body? 10. Is your mouth watering? Are you having any thoughts,” Hurry up and let me eat the chocolate!” “What’s taking so long?” If so, notice them and bring your attention back to smelling the chocolate. 11. Now slowly take a small bite of the chocolate, but do not chew it or swallow it. Notice the feeling and taste of the chocolate in your mouth. How does it feel as it melts? Notice the taste and sensations of the chocolate on your tongue. Move the chocolate around in your mouth. 12. Try to notice the moment where you feel like you want to swallow. Slowly swallow the chocolate, focusing on the sensations. Notice any lingering tastes or sensations. Questions to ask afterward: How was this different from your normal way of eating chocolate? What did you notice during the exercise? Any thoughts about how these principles might apply to eating or other areas of your life? best possible self 1. Take a moment to imagine your life in the future. What is the best possible life you can imagine? Consider all of the relevant areas of your life, such as your career, academic work, relationships, hobbies, and/or health. What would happen in these areas of your life in your best possible future? 2. For the next 15 minutes, write continuously about what you imagine this best possible future to be. Use the instructions below to help guide you through this process. 3. It may be easy for this exercise to lead you to examine how your current life may not match this best possible future. You may be tempted to think about ways in which accomplishing goals has been difficult for you in the past, or about financial/time/social barriers to being able to make these accomplishments happen. For the purpose of this exercise, however, we encourage you to focus on the future—imagine a brighter future in which you are your best self and your circumstances change just enough to make this best possible life happen. 4. This exercise is most useful when it is very specific—if you think about a new job, imagine exactly what you would do, who you would work with, and where it would be. The more specific you are, the more engaged you will be in the exercise and the more you’ll get out of it. 5. Be as creative and imaginative as you want, and don’t worry about grammar or spelling.
